- 👋 Hi, I’m @jorbotjones
- 👀 I’m interested in music (except pop-country), films, and political theory
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a Full-Stack developer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an idea for an app that interacts with music streaming services (think Letterboxd, but for music)... may delete later
